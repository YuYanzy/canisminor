# Quanda ICO

Quanda is a next-generation user-generated content community that incentivizes both content creators and curators. The goal of this content-oriented incentive platform is to reward users who engage with the platform in a way that traditional social communities do not. Quanda is the first blockchain-based content platform to combine fair, dynamic rewards mechanisms with a community-centric social network.

## The Problem

Traditional media platforms themselves become very valuable while pay little to the people who produce valuable contents. Their contributions and returns are not proportional.

#### Why?

- Traditional media platforms like Twitter take profits from the investor and advertisement but don’t share revenue.
- It is difficult for the traditional media platforms to calculate the value of one content.
- Content producers will not produce valuable content constantly without paying.
- The operators of the traditional media platforms cut down the relationship between the investors or the content consumers and those producers.

## The Solution

Tokens earned by your contribution producers could earn tokens through producing content with high quality, which could also help the community grow.

#### How?

- Tokens enable publishers to create mutually beneficial community based economic incentives to drive platform growth.
- Smart tokens with near instant settlement and zero transaction fees opens up new non-advertising business models.
- Publishers can also use the tokens to fundraise via an ‘Initial Coin Offering’ (ICO).
